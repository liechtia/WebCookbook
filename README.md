# WebCookbook

## Synopsis

This project is an online cookbook where users can add, change, delete and rate recipes. Non-users can view them and recalculate servings amounts of the ingredients. It is a project for the Web Engineering Course of the University of Fribourg, Autumn 2015

## Motivation

The goal of this project was to apply one of the technologies learned in the course. We chose to use ASP.NET MVC because we were already familiar with the programming language C#.

## Installation

Open the Solution in Visual Studio to get a local version running or find the deployed project under http://webcookbook.apphb.com. Unfortunately, pictures get deleted after a while on this free Appharbor account.
